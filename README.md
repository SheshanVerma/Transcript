As a computer science student, I created a transcript project as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) course. The project utilized various APIs to store and retrieve information about student records, including course information and GPA scores.

The main concept of the project was to develop a system that could efficiently store and organize student data, allowing for easy access and analysis of information. The system included a user interface that allowed students and faculty to view and manage their records, and an administrative interface for managing the system.

Throughout the project, I utilized various programming languages and technologies, including Java, Python, SQL, and REST APIs. I also utilized Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, to develop a modular and extensible system.

Overall, the transcript project demonstrated my proficiency in developing complex software systems and utilizing APIs to store and retrieve data. It also showcased my ability to apply OOPs concepts to real-world problems
